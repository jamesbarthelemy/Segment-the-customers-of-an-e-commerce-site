# Segment the customers of an e-commerce site

"A good level of customer knowledge allows the company to better know those who contribute to its commercial prosperity, in particular information on their profiles, their needs, their centers of interest and their expectations."

During this this project I will use the KMeans Clustering technique to provide actionable customer segments to an e-commerce site. Then I will proceed to the evaluation of the maintenance frequency based on an analysis of the stability of the segments over time.
